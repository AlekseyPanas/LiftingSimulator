# LiftingSimulator

Do you even lift bro? Well now you can... through python!
I made this simple experimental weight lifting game. The game uses complicated trigonometry to create skeleton lines which bend in the direction of a given coordinate on the 2d screen. I initially wanted to use this to make skeletal animation but for short term turned it into this project. Using the scroll wheel, you can make the 2 arms lift a heavy weight. Lift away!

### Dependencies:
